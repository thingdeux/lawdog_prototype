[Completed]

Refactored attack logic - added Hook

05/17/13
No Progress - OS crashed - rebuilt

05/16/13
Refactored enemy animation system to make flipping take less manual labor.
Implemented shin kicking animation and kicking collision detection and states.


05/15/13
Implemented jab / Enemy reaction to punch
Implemented walk to run animation / functionality.
-Weird bug when changing status of all enemies - changes those that don't need changes


05/14/13
-Implemented new Spritesheet - "wasted" time setting up each keyframe due to a mis-aligned spritesheet.  Eventually received all of the individual images from Joe and used spritesheet maker to create an aligned sheet.  Setup animation and grids with new sheet.
-- Need to fix collisions between entities - does not work on enemy v. enemy when colliding with the back

05/13/13
- Wind resistance too strong initially - pushes an idle character before speed is gained.  Maybe limit resistance to after 30 or so speed gained?*Fixed
-Walking isn't working *just* right, too much sliding*Fixed (For now)
-Refactor enemy code - Enemy won't walk to the left properly
